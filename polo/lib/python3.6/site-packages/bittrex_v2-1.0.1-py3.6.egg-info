Description: <h1>bittrex_v2</h1>
        
        Bittrex API v2 wrapper for Python3. Inspired in [platelminto](https://github.com/platelminto)'s [java wrapper](https://github.com/platelminto/java-bittrex-2). The API version is currently in beta (some endpoints may be fallen, see Testing section below). 
        
        Currently the `place_order()` method is not stable! Use a wrapper for Bittrex V1.1 API instead for place orders.
        
        ## Installation
        
        Install bittrex_v2 by running:
        
            git clone https://github.com/mondeja/bittrex_v2.git
            cd bittrex_v2
            python setup.py install
        
        ## Example usage
        ##### - Public commands:
        ```python
        >>> from bittrex_v2 import Bittrex
        >>> b = Bittrex()
        >>> b.get_open_orders()
        ```
        
        ##### - Private commands:
        ```python
        >>> b = Bittrex(api_key="<your api key>",
        ...             api_secret="<your api secret>")
        >>> b.get_open_orders('BTC-ETH')
        ```
        
        ## Testing
        Bittrex API v2 is currently in beta version, so that certain endpoints may be fallen. Execute `tests.py` for check all. 
        
        For test private commands methods you must provide key and secret in `secrets.json` file. For test `get_order(<uuid>)` method, you must provide a close order uuid in CONFIGURATION SECTION (`tests.py`).
